## Probability

### Objective probabiliy assumptions:

`P(S) = 1`  
`0 <= P(A) <= 1`  
`P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)`

### Independence:
Two events are called independent if event of A occuring or not occuring does not affect the probability of event B occuring

if A and B are independent:  
`P(A n B) = P (A and B) = P(A) * P(B)`
