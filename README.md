### about pre-order,in-order,post-order
```
  1
 / \
2   3
```

- pre,in,post declares where the root (1) will be
- About children: left always comes before right. 

pre-order = (**1**,2,3)

in-order = (2,**1**,3)

post-order = (2,3,**1**)

### binary tree preOrder iterative traverse

```java
while (node != null)
    result.add(node)
    if (node.right != null) stack.push(node.right)
    node = node.left
    if (node == null && !stack.isEmpty())
    node = stack.pop()
```

Process current node, stack the right element if any, and go left. pop in case there is no more left

### binary tree inOrder iterative traverse

```java
while (node != null || !stack.isEmpty())
    while (node != null)
        stack.push(node)
        node = node.left
    node = stack.pop()
    result.add(node)
    node = node.right
```

Go all the way left while stacking current. when there is no more left pop, process value. and go right
repeat until no more in stack and no more right to go.

### A cute trick about overflow

```java
(left + right) / 2 = left + (right-left)/2 
```
```java
left * right < target = left < target / right 
```

Left ones are prone to overflow for big left and right values, right ones are safe

```java
Integer.MAX_VALUE = -2^31 = 2147483647
Integer.MIN_VALUE = 2^31 - 1 = -2147483648
```

So when you are converting an Integer to its negative, you should handle the edge case of Integer.MIN_VALUE separately

### Constant time sorting
if you know the range of elements in an array. you can sort it in constant time by mapping counts to indices. for n = [0,50) you need an array of 50 elements You map values to indices and kep count.

```java
int[] exists = new int[50];
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    exists[nums[i]]++;
}
```
